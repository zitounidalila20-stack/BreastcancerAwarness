The purpose of a breast self-exam is to become familiar with the way your breasts normally look and feel.Knowing how your breasts normally look and feel, also called breast self-awareness, will  help you identify any changes or abnormalities in your breasts, such as a new lump or skin changes. Any changes in your breasts discovered during a breast self-exam should be reported to your healthcare provider right away. While a breast self-exam is a useful tool for the early detection of breast cancer, it should not take the place of regular mammograms and clinical breast exams."}
